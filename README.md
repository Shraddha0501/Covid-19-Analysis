# Covid-19-Analysis

In this project, I have performed data analysis on Covid-19 dataset that is available on Wikipedia, using Python and Tableau. I have scarped the data from Wikipedia using requests library. I have changed the names of columns for easy understanding. I have deleted the columns that are not necessary in the analysis. I have also removed the unnecessary rows from the dataset using the drop command. I have changed the column values using str.replace and finally changed the data types of the columns. I have exported the processed dataset to csv file to further analyze the data using Tableau.
Topics covered in this project:
•	Data Collection
